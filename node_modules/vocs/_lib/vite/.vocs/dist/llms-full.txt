  **Prerequisite:** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or higher).
</div>

### Setting Up Your Environment

Follow these steps to set up your development environment for working with Intersend:

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Start by installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Install Intersend SDK
npm install @intersend/sdk

# Install additional development dependencies
npm install @types/node typescript ts-node --save-dev
```

#### Step 2: Configure TypeScript (if using TypeScript)

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "declaration": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

#### Step 3: Create API Keys

1. Register as an Intersend developer at [https://developer.intersend.io](https://developer.intersend.io)
2. Create a new project and generate API keys
3. Store your API keys securely using environment variables:

```bash
# Create a .env file (don't commit this to version control)
echo "INTERSEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
echo "INTERSEND_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here" >> .env
```

### Development Workflow

#### Local Testing

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Install development server
npm install -g http-server

# Start a local server
http-server -p 8080
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Environment Variables

Create an `.env.local` file for development-specific variables:

```
INTERSEND_API_KEY=your_development_api_key
INTERSEND_ENVIRONMENT=testnet
DEBUG=true
```

#### Testing Transactions

When testing transactions in development:

1. Use testnet environments (Sepolia, Mumbai, etc.)
2. Get test tokens from appropriate faucets
3. Set lower confirmation requirements in your config:

```javascript
const devConfig = {
  confirmations: 1,
  networkId: 11155111, // Sepolia testnet
  gaslessMode: true
};
```

### Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common development issues:

#### Network Connectivity Issues

If you're experiencing network connectivity problems:

1. Verify your API keys are correct
2. Check your RPC endpoint availability
3. Ensure you're connected to the correct network
4. Try using a different RPC provider

#### Transaction Failures

For transaction-related issues:

1. Ensure your wallet has sufficient funds (native token + gas)
2. Verify contract addresses are correct for the network
3. Check transaction parameters (gas, nonce, etc.)
4. Enable debug logging for more information:

```javascript
const intersend = new Intersend({
  debug: true,
  logLevel: 'verbose'
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Never hardcode API keys** - Use environment variables
2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Implement proper error handling
3. **Test on testnets first** - Always verify on testnets before production
4. **Implement proper validation** - Validate all user inputs
5. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update SDK versions

### Ways to Integrate

#### 1. You have an existing web app

If you have an existing web application, we can embed your app as an iframe within the Intersend App Store. Your app will communicate with Intersend through a standardized messaging system.

The iframe sends events, such as making a transaction with details to the deposit address. We capture and process these events on the backend and send the response back to the developer's iframe or web app, which then displays the details to the frontend.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant YourApp as Your App (iframe)
    participant Intersend as Intersend Backend
    participant Blockchain

    User->>YourApp: Accesses App on Intersend Store
    YourApp->>Intersend: Sends Event (e.g., transaction)
    Intersend->>Blockchain: Processes Event
    Blockchain-->>Intersend: Returns Result
    Intersend-->>YourApp: Sends Event Result
    YourApp->>User: Displays Result
```

##### Integration Steps

1. Prepare Your App: Ensure your app can run within an iframe and handle postMessage communication.

2. Install Required Dependencies

```javascript
npm install viem
# or
yarn add viem
```

3. Implement Transaction Preparation Function

```javascript
import { parseEther, encodeFunctionData } from 'viem';

const prepareTransaction = (to, amount, tokenAddress) => {
  // Encode the function call for a token transfer
  const data = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: [{
      inputs: [
        { name: 'recipient', type: 'address' },
        { name: 'amount', type: 'uint256' }
      ],
      name: 'transfer',
      type: 'function'
    }],
    args: [to, parseEther(amount)]
  });

  return {
    to: tokenAddress,
    data,
    value: '0' // Use '0' for token transfers
  };
};
```

4. Implement Message Handling: Set up event listeners for messages from Intersend:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleMessage = (event) => {
    if (event.origin !== "https://app.intersend.io") return;

    const { id, result } = event.data;
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Transaction successful:', result.data);
      // Update your UI to show success
    } else {
      console.error('Transaction failed:', result.message);
      // Update your UI to show failure
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('message', handleMessage);
}, []);
```

5. Send Transaction

```javascript
const sendTransaction = (recipient, amount, tokenAddress) => {
  const txData = prepareTransaction(recipient, amount, tokenAddress);

  window.parent.postMessage({
    method: 'sendTransactions',
    params: {
      txs: [txData],
      chainId: '137' // Replace with your target chain ID
    },
    id: `tx-${Date.now()}` // Unique ID for this transaction
  }, 'https://app.intersend.io');
};
```

6. Update your UI

```javascript
// the following snippet is provided as a reference

return (
  <div>
    <input 
      type="text" 
      placeholder="Recipient Address" 
      onChange={(e) => setRecipient(e.target.value)} 
    />
    <input 
      type="text" 
      placeholder="Amount" 
      onChange={(e) => setAmount(e.target.value)} 
    />
    <button onClick={() => sendTransaction(recipient, amount, tokenAddress)}>
      Send Transaction
    </button>
    {/* Display transaction status here */}
  </div>
);
```

### Introduction

If your company is using [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/), we have a convenient way to integrate Intersend Wallet. By simply adding a new file with our custom wallet configuration and updating the RainbowKit configuration, you can enable seamless wallet integration for your users.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure that Polygon is included in the "chains" in your wagmi.ts. If Polygon is not accepted, please contact [hello@intersend.io](mailto\:hello@intersend.io) for further details about how to add custom authentication within RainbowKit. However, please note that Intersend supports transactions on any chain, not just Polygon.

### Adding Intersend Wallet

#### Step 1: Create the Intersend Wallet File

Create a new file in the same directory where `wagmi.ts` is located. Name this file `intersend-wallet.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { Wallet, getWalletConnectConnector } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

export interface IntersendWalletOptions {
  projectId: string;
}

export const IntersendWallet = ({ projectId }: IntersendWalletOptions): Wallet => ({
  id: 'intersend',
  name: 'Intersend',
  iconUrl: 'https://intersend-content-s3-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/intersend-rounded-no-background.jpg',
  iconBackground: '#6b8cfe',
  downloadUrls: {
    qrCode: 'https://intersend-content-s3-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/styled_qr_with_logo.png',
  },
  mobile: {
    getUri: (uri: string) => {
      console.log('WalletConnect URI (mobile):', uri);
      window.parent.postMessage({ type: 'walletconnect_uri', uri }, '*'); // Post message to parent
      return uri;
    },
  },
  qrCode: {
    getUri: (uri: string) => {
      console.log('WalletConnect URI (QR code):', uri);
      window.parent.postMessage({ type: 'walletconnect_uri', uri }, '*'); // Post message to parent
      return uri;
    },
    instructions: {
      learnMoreUrl: 'https://app.intersend.io',
      steps: [
        {
          description: 'Create your non-custodial wallet with a single email.',
          step: 'install',
          title: 'Sign-up to Intersend',
        },
        {
          description: 'Use Intersend\'s app store to instantly connect your wallet into this app.',
          step: 'connect',
          title: 'Open this app on InterSpace',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  createConnector: getWalletConnectConnector({ projectId }),
});
```

#### Step 2: Update the RainbowKit Configuration

In your `wagmi.ts` file, add the following code to integrate the Intersend Wallet:

1. Import the Intersend Wallet:

```typescript
import { IntersendWallet } from './intersend-wallet';
import { connectorsForWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { polygon } from 'wagmi/chains';
```

2. Add the Intersend Wallet to the connectors:

```typescript
const connectors = connectorsForWallets(
  [
    {
      groupName: 'Recommended',
      wallets: [IntersendWallet],
    },
  ],
  {
    appName: 'Intersend',
    projectId: '936ce227c0152a29bdeef7d68794b0ac',
  }
);
```

3. Ensure Polygon is included in the chains and transports:

```typescript
export const config = createConfig({
  connectors: connectors, // Add the connectors configuration
  chains: [mainnet, polygon], // Ensure Polygon is included in the chains
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
    [polygon.id]: http(), // Ensure Polygon transport is configured
  },
  ssr: true,
});
```

After this step, please reach out to us at [hello@intersend.io](mailto\:hello@intersend.io) to get your app listed on InterSpace.

#### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can integrate the Intersend Wallet with your RainbowKit configuration, providing a seamless wallet experience for your users. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please contact [hello@intersend.io](mailto\:hello@intersend.io).

### Ways to Integrate

#### 1. Your Web Application Hosted by Yourself (such as iframe)

Your component (this could be an iframe or a webpage directly) will be hosted by you and accessed through the Intersend App Store.

The iframe sends events, such as making a transaction with details to the deposit address. We capture and process these events on the backend and send the response back to the developer's iframe or web app, which then displays the details to the frontend.

```plaintext
User                  Developer's App (Accessed via Intersend)       Intersend Backend
 |                                   |                                   |
 |-- Access App on Store ----------->|                                   |
 |                                   |                                   |
 |                                   |- Send Event (e.g., transaction) ->|
 |                                   |                                   |
 |                                   |                                   |-- Process Event ------------------>|
 |                                   |                                   |
 |                                   |                                   |<-- Transaction Result -------------|
 |                                   |<-- Receive Event Result ----------|
 |                                   |                                   |
 |<-- Display Result ----------------|                                   |
```

#### 2. Intersend Iframe Integration

You can utilize our iframe component that you can add to your website.

Our iframe is a light version of Intersend. It essentially provides a button that opens a pop-up window where users can log in, see their balance, approve transactions, and more.

For each event, your app and our app will constantly share these events with each other and execute relevant functions. These events include obtaining certain permissions, creating payment records, processing transactions, and more.

### APIs

With our APIs, you can create user wallets and enable them to receive any cryptocurrency on any chain, including EVM, Bitcoin, Solana, and many others.

#### Create User Wallet

```code
curl -X POST https://node.intersend.io/v1/appstore/create-user \
-H "Authorization: Bearer authToken" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "user@example.com"
  // or "walletAddress"
}'
```

This endpoint returns a link for the user to log in to the Intersend dashboard.

```plaintext
Developer              Intersend API              Intersend Database
 |                        |                           |
 |-- Create User Request->|                           |
 |                        |                           |
 |<-- User Login Link ----|                           |
 |                        |                           |
 |                        |-- Store User Data ------->|
```

#### Generate Wallet Address

```code
curl -X POST https://node.intersend.io/v1/appstore/generate-wallet-address \
-H "Authorization: Bearer authToken" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
 "email": "user@example.com",
 "chain": "BTC",
 "crypto": "BTC"
}'
```

This endpoint returns a wallet address of the selected currency and a payment URI. If the user deposits funds to this address, their Intersend account will be deposited with the equivalent amount of USDT.

The user can sign into their Intersend account and access the funds.

### Event Types

#### request\_permission

This is the very initial step your app needs to ask the user. Typically, this is a one-time event for each user depending on your use case. You'd pass some security parameters such as:

* `max_limit`: The maximum amount limit your app will use.
* `access_expiry`: The expiration time for the access.
* `user_wallet_address`: The wallet address of the user.
* `domain_whitelist`: The list of domains that are allowed to access the permissions. (Your originating domain)

#### payment\_intent

You can pass the information for payment such as the target wallet, amount, chain, and cryptocurrency (chain-agnostic). We then validate your permissions, process the transaction, and send the details through an event callback.

* `target_wallet`: The wallet address where the payment will be sent.
* `amount`: The amount of cryptocurrency to be sent.
* `chain`: The blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin).
* `crypto`: The type of cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, ETH).

#### create\_user

Initiate the process to create a new user within the Intersend ecosystem. This event sets up the necessary user profile.

* `email`: The email address of the user.
* `wallet_address`: The wallet address of the user (optional if email is provided).

#### generate\_wallet\_address

Generate a new wallet address for the user on a specified blockchain. This event returns a wallet address and a payment URI.

* `email`: The email address of the user.
* `chain`: The blockchain network for the wallet (e.g., BTC, ETH).
* `crypto`: The type of cryptocurrency for the wallet (e.g., BTC, ETH).

#### transaction\_status

Check the status of a previously initiated transaction. This event provides updates on whether the transaction was successful, pending, or failed.

* `transaction_id`: The unique identifier of the transaction.

#### revoke\_permission

Revoke previously granted permissions from a user. This event can be used to ensure security and compliance with user requests.

* `user_wallet_address`: The wallet address of the user.
* `permission_id`: The identifier of the permission to be revoked.

These events provide a comprehensive set of interactions that developers can use to build robust applications within the Intersend App Store ecosystem.

#### Smart Contracts

We use ERC-4337 smart contracts to facilitate secure and efficient transactions within the Intersend ecosystem.

## API Reference

Welcome to the Intersend API documentation. This section provides detailed information about our API endpoints, authentication methods, and request/response formats.

### Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You'll need to include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is:

```
https://api.intersend.io/v1
```

### Endpoints

Our API provides the following main endpoint categories:

* [Create Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/create) - Create new resources
* [Get Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get) - Retrieve resource data
* [Delete Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/delete) - Remove resources

### Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format and follow a standard structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data goes here
  },
  "error": null
}
```

In case of an error, the response will include error details:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error description"
  }
}

## Dynamic Integration

### Prerequisite

* Your existing web app is powered by [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz) for authentication and embedded wallet management.

### Integration Steps

#### 1. Install Intersend EVM Wallet Connector

Install the Dynamic Intersend EVM wallet connector with the following command:

For Dynamic v3:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs-connectors/intersend-evm@3.2.4
# or
yarn add @dynamic-labs-connectors/intersend-evm@3.2.4
```

For Dynamic v4:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs-connectors/intersend-evm@4.0.0
# or
yarn add @dynamic-labs-connectors/intersend-evm@4.0.0
```

#### 2. Import the Intersend Connector

In your project import the IntersendEvmWalletConnectors:

```tsx
import { IntersendEvmWalletConnectors } from '@dynamic-labs-connectors/intersend-evm';
```

#### 3. Configure Dynamic Provider

Add the Intersend EVM wallet connector to your DynamicContextProvider:

```tsx
<DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors, IntersendEvmWalletConnectors]
  }}
>
  {/* Your app code here */}
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

#### 4. Whitelist Intersend Domain

Add Intersend domains to your Dynamic dashboard's allowed origins:

* [https://app.intersend.io](https://app.intersend.io)
* [https://intersend.io](https://intersend.io)

[Configure Allowed Origins →](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/developer-dashboard/security#adding-an-origin)

#### 5. Verify App Behavior Inside Intersend

1. **Open [Sandbox](https://app.intersend.io/apps/sandbox)** and paste your web app's URL into the address bar of the Intersend browser.
2. **Auto-connect** should kick in; Intersend will inject the user's wallet data into your app.
3. **Test transaction or signing flows** to confirm everything relays properly.

#### 6. Get Listed

Once integrated submit your app for review:

* Email: [hello@intersend.io](mailto\:hello@intersend.io)
* Telegram: @erturkarda

        return true;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Wallet login/link error:', err);
        throw err;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }, [wallets]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!ready || isConnecting || !window.ethereum?._state?.accounts?.length) {
      return;
    }

    const autoConnect = async () => {
      try {
        setIsConnecting(true);
        setError(null);

        const address = window.ethereum._state.accounts[0];
        const connected = await connectWallet(address);

        if (!connected) {
          console.log('No matching wallet found for address:', address);
        }
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Auto-connect error:', err);
        setError(err);
      } finally {
        setIsConnecting(false);
      }
    };

    autoConnect();
  }, [ready, wallets, isConnecting, connectWallet]);

  return { isConnecting, error };
}

/**
 * Component that handles auto-connection of Intersend wallet
 * Usage: Just include this component in your app's provider wrapper
 * <AutoConnectHandler />
 */
export function AutoConnectHandler() {
  const { isConnecting, error } = useIntersendAutoConnect();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (error) {
      console.error('Auto-connect error:', error);
      // You can add additional error handling here like showing a toast notification
      // toast.error('Failed to auto-connect wallet');
    }
  }, [error]);

  // Component doesn't render anything
  return null;
}

// Export both the hook and the component
export { useIntersendAutoConnect };

// Default export is the component for easier imports
export default AutoConnectHandler;
```

#### 2. Configure Providers

Import and set up the connector and auto-connect handler in your app's provider configuration:

```tsx
import './intersend-connector'
import { AutoConnectHandler } from './hooks/useIntersendAutoConnect'

export default function Providers({ children }) {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider appId={privyAppId} config={...}>
      <WagmiProvider config={wagmiConfig}>
        {/* AutoConnectHandler manages wallet connection when app is loaded in Intersend */}
        <AutoConnectHandler />
        {children}
      </WagmiProvider>
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Whitelist Intersend Domain

Add Intersend domains to your Privy dashboard's allowed origins:

* [https://app.intersend.io](https://app.intersend.io)
* [https://intersend.io](https://intersend.io)

[Configure Allowed Origins →](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/configuration/allowed-domains)

#### 4. Verify App Behavior Inside Intersend

1. **Open [Sandbox](https://app.intersend.io/apps/sandbox)** and paste your web app's URL into the address bar of the Intersend browser.
2. **Auto-connect** should kick in; Intersend will inject the user's wallet data into your app.
3. **Test transaction or signing flows** to confirm everything relays properly.

#### 5. Get Listed

Once integrated submit your app for review:

* Email: [hello@intersend.io](mailto\:hello@intersend.io)
* Telegram: @erturkarda

## Safe Integration

### Prerequisite

* Your dApp uses **Wagmi** for wallet interactions.
* If using an auth provider (e.g. Privy, Dynamic) refer to its dedicated Intersend guide.

### Integration Steps (Wagmi + Safe Example)

Below is the most common scenario: **you already use Wagmi** and need to ensure the Safe Connector is present so Intersend can auto-connect. If your app relies on Privy or Dynamic for auth, please see those guides.

#### 1. Add (or Confirm) Safe Connector

Add the Safe connector to your Wagmi config. If your app already uses the Safe connector, you can skip this step.

```ts
import { createConfig, http } from 'wagmi'
import { mainnet, sepolia, polygon } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { createClient } from 'viem'
import { safe } from 'wagmi/connectors'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet, sepolia, polygon],
  connectors: [
    safe() // Add Safe connector
    // other connectors...
  ],
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
    [sepolia.id]: http(),
    [polygon.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

#### 2. Verify Integration

Once your app has the Safe connector configured:

1. **Test in [Sandbox](https://app.intersend.io/apps/sandbox)** - Load your app URL in the Intersend sandbox environment
2. **Auto-connect** should happen automatically - Intersend detects Safe connector and injects wallet data
3. **Test key functions** - Ensure signing requests and transactions work properly

#### 3. Get Listed

Once integrated, submit your app for review:

* Email: [hello@intersend.io](mailto\:hello@intersend.io)
* Telegram: @erturkarda

## Auth Providers Overview

> **This guide is for you if:**
>
> You provide authentication/wallet management infrastructure (e.g Privy, Dynamic) and want to:
>
> * Make client apps portable across Web3 interfaces (Worlcoin, Frames, Telegram, Safe)
> * Offer embeddable apps as a value-add feature
> * Expand ecosystem reach without additional work

Turn every app using your SDK into an embeddable component for Intersend-integrated wallets and platforms.

### Integration Benefits

* **Ecosystem Growth**
  Client apps become instantly available to all Intersend partner wallets
* **Zero Client Changes**
  Add Intersend connector at SDK layer - no app modifications needed
* **Universal Compatibility**
  Works with any partner wallet - making it easy to integrate apps with a few lines of code

***

### How It Works

Below is a simplified flow describing how an app (built with your auth SDK) interacts with a user's wallet through Intersend.

### Example

1. A wallet infrastructure provider (let's call this CoinPace Wallet) uses Intersend SDK to add "App X" into their explore page. *App X is built with your authentication SDK.*

2. Users click App X within CoinPace Wallet's interface. The app loads in an iframe.

3. Your Authentication SDK automatically injects Intersend's connector to App X at initial page load.

4. Intersend's iframe middleware facilitates sharing user's account with the app and automatically connects to it with SIWE (Sign in with Ethereum)

5. When transactions occur:
   1. App X constructs transaction data
   2. Intersend relays payload to CoinPace Wallet
   3. User approves/declines in native wallet UI
   4. Result propagates back to the app

#### End Result

* The app is fully functional automatically connected to the user's wallet/account
* Transactions signatures chain switching etc. flow through Intersend's secure layer

## Code Examples

This page demonstrates how to include code examples in your documentation. Vocs provides powerful code formatting and highlighting capabilities.

### Basic Code Blocks

You can create a simple code block by using triple backticks and specifying the language:

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript example
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello from Intersend!");
  return true;
}
```

### Syntax Highlighting

Vocs supports syntax highlighting for various languages:

#### TypeScript

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  wallets: string[];
}

function createUser(name: string): User {
  return {
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    name,
    wallets: []
  };
}
```

#### Solidity

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract IntersendWallet {
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function transfer(address payable recipient, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        recipient.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

#### JSON

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "usr_123456",
    "wallets": [
      {
        "address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e",
        "network": "ethereum"
      }
    ],
    "preferences": {
      "theme": "dark",
      "notifications": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Code Highlighting

You can highlight specific lines in your code to draw attention to important parts:

```typescript [3-5]
import { Wallet } from '@intersend/sdk';

// This line and the next two will be highlighted
const wallet = new Wallet({
  apiKey: process.env.INTERSEND_API_KEY
});

const balance = await wallet.getBalance();
```

### Inline Code

You can also include `inline code` within your text for referring to variables, functions, or short code snippets.

### Code with Comments

Use comments to explain what's happening in your code:

```javascript
// Initialize the SDK with your API key
const client = new IntersendClient({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'  // Replace with your actual API key
});

// Create a new wallet for the user
const wallet = await client.createWallet({
  userId: '123',          // Unique identifier for the user
  network: 'ethereum'     // Which blockchain network to use
});

// The wallet is now ready to use!
console.log(wallet.address);
```

### Terminal Commands

Show terminal commands with a bash code block:

```bash
# Install the SDK
npm install @intersend/sdk

# Initialize a new project
npx intersend init my-project

# Start the development server
cd my-project
npm run dev
```

### React Component Examples

Display React component usage:

```jsx
import { WalletConnect } from '@intersend/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>My Intersend App</h1>
      
      <WalletConnect 
        clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        onConnect={(wallet) => console.log('Connected:', wallet)}
      />
      
      {/* The rest of your application */}
    </div>
  );
}
```


## Images and Media

Adding visual elements to your documentation can significantly improve comprehension and user engagement. This guide shows how to add images, diagrams, and other media to your Intersend documentation.

### Adding Images

Images in Vocs documentation can be added using standard Markdown syntax or through HTML/JSX for more control.

#### Basic Image Syntax

```md
![Alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```

#### Placing Images in Your Documentation

1. Place your images in the `public/images` directory
2. Reference them using paths relative to the public directory:

```md
![Intersend Wallet Interface](/images/wallet-interface.png)
```

#### Styled Images

For more control over image display, you can use HTML with styling:

```jsx
<img 
  src="/images/diagram.png" 
  alt="Architecture Diagram" 
  style={{ 
    maxWidth: '100%',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'
  }} 
/>
```

### Image Captions

Add captions below your images for additional context:

```jsx
<figure>
  <img src="/images/transaction-flow.png" alt="Transaction Flow Diagram" />
  <figcaption>Fig 1: Flow of a transaction through the Intersend network</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Diagrams

You can add diagrams using Mermaid syntax for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Signs Transaction| B[Intersend SDK]
    B -->|Submits to| C[Relay Network]
    C -->|Broadcasts to| D[Blockchain]
    D -->|Confirms| E[Transaction Complete]
    E -->|Notifies| A
```

### Responsive Images

For images that should scale with viewport size:

```jsx
<div style={{ maxWidth: '100%', overflow: 'auto' }}>
  <img 
    src="/images/large-diagram.png" 
    alt="Network Architecture" 
    style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '800px' }} 
  />
</div>
```

### Dark and Light Mode Images

For different images based on color scheme:

```jsx
<>
  <img 
    className="block dark:hidden" 
    src="/images/light-mode.png" 
    alt="Light mode diagram" 
  />
  <img 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
    src="/images/dark-mode.png" 
    alt="Dark mode diagram" 
  />
</>
```

### Asset Organization

Keep your images organized using a logical structure:

```
public/
└── images/
    ├── logos/
    │   ├── intersend-logo.svg
    │   └── partner-logos/
    ├── diagrams/
    │   ├── architecture.png
    │   └── flow-charts/
    ├── screenshots/
    │   ├── dashboard.png
    │   └── wallet-view.png
    └── icons/
        └── file-types/
```

### Image Best Practices

1. **Optimize image sizes** before adding them to documentation
2. **Use SVG** for logos and icons when possible
3. **Provide meaningful alt text** for accessibility
4. **Keep a consistent style** across diagrams and screenshots
5. **Use proper resolution** images (2x for high-DPI displays)


## Markdown Syntax

### Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

#### Subtitles

Best used for subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

> **Tip:** Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

### Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**          |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | *italic*          |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get ***bold and italic*** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

### Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to code examples](/essentials/code)` links to the page "Code Examples" in our essentials section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because they cannot be optimized as easily.

### Blockquotes

#### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

#### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### Math Expressions

You can include mathematical expressions using standard Markdown math syntax with dollar signs:

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

```md
Inline math: $E = mc^2$
```

Block math:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

```md
$$
E = mc^2
$$
```


## Navigation

The navigation menu is the list of links shown in the sidebar of your documentation website.

You will likely update `vocs.config.ts` every time you add a new page. Pages do not show up automatically in the navigation.

### Sidebar Configuration

The sidebar configuration in Vocs is defined in the `vocs.config.ts` file. It supports a hierarchical structure that allows for nested navigation groups.

#### Basic Sidebar Structure

```typescript
// vocs.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vocs'

export default defineConfig({
  title: 'Project Name',
  // Basic sidebar with top-level links
  sidebar: [
    {
      text: 'Getting Started',
      link: '/getting-started'
    },
    {
      text: 'Features',
      link: '/features'
    }
  ]
})
```

#### Nested Navigation Groups

You can create nested navigation groups by using the `items` property:

```typescript
// vocs.config.ts
sidebar: [
  {
    text: 'Getting Started',
    link: '/getting-started'
  },
  {
    text: 'API Reference',
    // Nested items
    items: [
      { text: 'Introduction', link: '/api-reference/introduction' },
      { text: 'Authentication', link: '/api-reference/authentication' },
      { 
        text: 'Endpoints',
        // Further nesting is possible
        items: [
          { text: 'Create', link: '/api-reference/endpoint/create' },
          { text: 'Read', link: '/api-reference/endpoint/read' }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Collapsible Sections

You can make sections collapsible using the `collapsed` property:

```typescript
sidebar: [
  {
    text: 'API Reference',
    collapsed: true, // Section will be collapsed by default
    items: [
      { text: 'Introduction', link: '/api-reference/introduction' },
      { text: 'Authentication', link: '/api-reference/authentication' }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Page Organization

Pages should be organized in a logical directory structure that matches your navigation hierarchy:

```
docs/
└── pages/
    ├── index.mdx              # Home page
    ├── getting-started.mdx    # /getting-started
    ├── features.mdx           # /features
    └── api-reference/
        ├── introduction.mdx   # /api-reference/introduction
        ├── authentication.mdx # /api-reference/authentication
        └── endpoint/
            ├── create.mdx     # /api-reference/endpoint/create
            └── read.mdx       # /api-reference/endpoint/read
```

Always ensure that your directory structure aligns with the paths you specify in your sidebar configuration.


## Reusable Snippets

Documentation often requires repeating the same content in multiple places. Reusable snippets allow you to define content once and reuse it throughout your documentation.

### Basic Snippet Usage

Snippets allow you to store reusable content that can be included in multiple pages. This helps maintain consistency and reduces duplication.

#### Creating Snippets

To create a snippet:

1. Add files in the `docs/snippets` directory with your reusable content
2. Use clear, descriptive names for your snippet files
3. Write your content in MDX format

For example, create a file at `docs/snippets/wallet-setup.mdx`:

```mdx
## Setting Up Your Wallet

To set up your Intersend wallet:

1. Download the Intersend app or visit [web.intersend.io](https://web.intersend.io)
2. Click "Create New Wallet"
3. Choose your preferred authentication method
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to secure your wallet
```

#### Using Snippets in Documentation

You can then import and use this snippet in any of your documentation pages:

```mdx
import WalletSetup from '../snippets/wallet-setup.mdx'

# Getting Started

Before you can start using Intersend, you need to set up your wallet.

<WalletSetup />

Now that your wallet is set up, let's explore the features...
```

### Advanced Snippet Techniques

#### Parameterized Snippets

You can pass parameters to your snippets for more flexibility:

```mdx
export const ApiEndpoint = ({ method, endpoint, description }) => (
  <div className="api-endpoint">
    <div className="method">{method}</div>
    <div className="endpoint">{endpoint}</div>
    <div className="description">{description}</div>
  </div>
);
```

Then use it with different values:

```mdx
<ApiEndpoint 
  method="GET" 
  endpoint="/api/v1/wallets" 
  description="Retrieve all user wallets" 
/>
```

#### Snippet Categories

Organize your snippets into logical categories:

```
docs/
└── snippets/
    ├── setup/
    │   ├── wallet-setup.mdx
    │   └── api-setup.mdx
    ├── errors/
    │   ├── common-errors.mdx
    │   └── error-handling.mdx
    └── examples/
        ├── react-example.mdx
        └── node-example.mdx
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep snippets atomic** - Design snippets for a single, specific purpose
2. **Maintain consistency** - Use consistent naming and formatting
3. **Update centrally** - When changes are needed, update the snippet once
4. **Document parameters** - For parameterized snippets, document expected parameters
5. **Version control** - Keep snippets under version control along with your documentation


## Configuration Settings

```javascript
// Initialize Intersend with configuration options
const intersend = new Intersend({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  environment: 'production',
  networkId: 1, // Ethereum Mainnet
  gaslessMode: true,
  callbacks: {
    onConnect: (walletAddress) => {
      console.log(`Connected to wallet: ${walletAddress}`);
    },
    onDisconnect: () => {
      console.log('Wallet disconnected');
    }
  }
});
```

### Advanced Settings

#### Authentication Options

You can configure how users authenticate with your application:

```javascript
const authConfig = {
  methods: ['email', 'social', 'wallet'],
  requireVerification: true,
  redirectUrl: 'https://your-app.com/dashboard',
  termsOfServiceUrl: 'https://your-app.com/terms',
  privacyPolicyUrl: 'https://your-app.com/privacy'
};
```

#### Transaction Settings

Control how transactions are handled:

```javascript
const txConfig = {
  confirmations: 2,            // Number of confirmations to wait for
  timeout: 60000,              // Transaction timeout in milliseconds
  gasMultiplier: 1.2,          // Multiply estimated gas by this factor
  maxFeePerGas: '50000000000', // Maximum fee per gas in wei
  nonce: 'auto'                // Use 'auto' or provide a specific nonce
};
```

#### Network Configuration

Configure network-specific settings:

```javascript
const networks = {
  ethereum: {
    rpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY',
    chainId: 1,
    blockExplorerUrl: 'https://etherscan.io'
  },
  polygon: {
    rpcUrl: 'https://polygon-rpc.com',
    chainId: 137,
    blockExplorerUrl: 'https://polygonscan.com'
  }
};
```

### Callback Events

| Event            | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `onConnect`      | Fired when a wallet is connected      |
| `onDisconnect`   | Fired when a wallet is disconnected   |
| `onTransaction`  | Fired when a transaction is initiated |
| `onConfirmation` | Fired when a transaction is confirmed |
| `onError`        | Fired when an error occurs            |

### Environment Variables

For server-side implementations, you can use environment variables:

```
INTERSEND_API_KEY=your_api_key
INTERSEND_ENVIRONMENT=production
INTERSEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

#### Security Architecture

The SDK implements a secure messaging protocol between the embedded app and your wallet:

* Apps run in isolated iframes with specific permissions
* All cryptographic operations occur within your wallet's secure environment
* Transaction requests are handled by your wallet's native signing flow
* No direct access to user's private keys or sensitive data

### Quick Integration Guide

#### 1. Install the SDK

```bash
npm install universal-portability
```

#### 2. Fetch Available Apps

```javascript
const fetchApps = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.intersend.com/v1/intersend/interspace/apps', {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  });
  const apps = await response.json();
};
```

#### 3. Embed an App

```javascript
import { Port } from 'universal-portability';

function AppContainer({ appUrl, walletAddress, rpcUrl }) {
  return (
    <Port
      src={`https://intersend.io/${app.slug}`}
      accountAddress={walletAddress}
      rpcUrl={rpcUrl}
    />
  );
}
```

#### 4. Message Handling & Transactions

```typescript
import { sendMessageToIframe } from 'universal-portability';

// Setup message listener when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('message', handleMessages);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('message', handleMessages);
}, []);

// Main message handler
const handleMessages = async (event: MessageEvent) => {
  // Validate message origin for security
  if (event.origin !== 'https://app.intersend.io') return;
  
  const { type, payload, id } = event.data;
  
  switch (type) {
    case 'REQUEST_WALLET_INFO':
      // Respond with wallet details
      sendMessageToIframe({
        type: 'WALLET_INFO',
        payload: {
          address: walletAddress,
          chainId: '0x89', // Polygon
          isConnected: true
        },
        id
      });
      break;
      
    case 'RPC_REQUEST':
      if (payload.method === 'eth_sendTransaction') {
        try {
          // Transaction parameters from the app
          const txParams = payload.params[0];
          
          // Show your wallet's native transaction UI
          const approved = await showTransactionApproval(txParams);
          
          if (approved) {
            // Sign and send transaction using your wallet's infrastructure
            const txHash = await handleTransaction(txParams);
            
            // Respond with transaction hash
            sendMessageToIframe({
              type: 'RPC_RESPONSE',
              payload: txHash,
              id
            });
          } else {
            // User rejected - send error response
            sendMessageToIframe({
              type: 'RPC_RESPONSE',
              error: {
                code: 4001,
                message: 'User rejected transaction'
              },
              id
            });
          }
        } catch (error) {
          // Handle any errors during transaction
          sendMessageToIframe({
            type: 'RPC_RESPONSE',
            error: {
              code: 4000,
              message: error.message
            },
            id
          });
        }
      }
      break;
  }
};
```

#### Message Protocol

The SDK uses a secure postMessage protocol for communication:

* `REQUEST_WALLET_INFO`: App requests wallet connection details
* `WALLET_INFO`: Wallet responds with account information
* `RPC_REQUEST`: App requests transaction signing or other RPC methods
* `RPC_RESPONSE`: Wallet responds with transaction result

All sensitive operations (signing, approvals) are handled by your wallet's existing security infrastructure, ensuring a safe and consistent user experience.

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself). This is a principle that apply to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.


## Wallets & WaaS Overview

> **This guide is for you if:**
>
> You provide wallet infrastructure (MPC, custodial, non-custodial) (e.g., UniversalX, MetaMask, Phantom) and want to:
>
> * Offer curated dApps without maintaining it yourself
> * Keep full control over security and UX
> * Automatically integrate new apps added to Intersend

### Demo

See a demo of an Intersend-powered wallet:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb8bpSt_qAY?si=CrAPF8gv57AiUIkd" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen />

[Github Repo](https://github.com/intersend/demo-wallet)

Turn your wallet into a Web3 gateway using Intersend's universal connector. Embed dApps directly into your interface while maintaining full control over security and user experience.

### Why Intersend?

* **Zero Maintenance**
  New apps become automatically available to your users - no integration work required
* **Security First**
  All transactions use your existing signing infrastructure - keys never leave your environment
* **Customizable Curation**
  Choose which apps to display and control their presentation

***

### How It Works

Under the hood, Intersend provides an iframe-based connector that mediates communication between your wallet and apps available on Intersend. Your wallet remains in control of signing, transaction approvals, and chain selection while Intersend relays messages securely via `postMessage`.

    Intersend->>App: Wraps the app within Intersend interface
    Intersend->>Wallet: REQUEST_WALLET_INFO
    Intersend->>App: WALLET_INFO (address chainId)

    Note over User,App: Transaction Flow
    User->>App: Initiates transaction (e.g. purchase swap)
    App->>Intersend: eth_sendTransaction (RPC request)
    Intersend->>Wallet: Constructs and sends tx data
    Wallet->>User: Prompts user to approve transaction
    User->>Wallet: Approves
    Wallet->>Wallet: Signs & broadcasts to blockchain
    Wallet->>Intersend: Returns txHash (RPC response)
    Intersend->>App: Send success or fail
    App-->>User: Shows success/fail message
```

### Security Architecture

The SDK implements a secure messaging protocol between the embedded app and your wallet:

* **Isolated Iframes:**
  All third-party dApps are sandboxed within an iframe managed by Intersend. This prevents unauthorized access to your code or your users' private keys.

* **No Private Key Exposure:**
  Any signature or transaction request is forwarded to your wallet's internal signing logic. Keys never leave your environment.

* **Origin Validation:**
  The Intersend SDK verifies the origin of incoming messages. Suspicious or unknown sources are ignored.

## WaaS Quickstart Guide

> **Tip:** See our [complete wallet implementation on Github](https://github.com/intersend/demo-wallet) for a production-ready example of integrating Intersend apps into a wallet.

### 1. Install the SDK

```bash
npm install universal-portability
```

### 2. Set Up Provider

Wrap your application with the UniversalPortabilityProvider:

```javascript
import { UniversalPortabilityProvider } from 'universal-portability';

function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={wagmiConfig}>
      <UniversalPortabilityProvider>
        {/* Your app */}
      </UniversalPortabilityProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Implement Message Handlers

Your wallet needs to listen for events from Intersend—such as requests to connect, sign a message, or approve a transaction.

Create these two hooks to handle communication between your wallet and embedded dApps:

#### src/hooks/useMessageHandler.ts

```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useUniversalPortability } from 'universal-portability';
import { sendTransaction, signMessage } from '@wagmi/core';
import { config } from '../wagmi';
import { hexToString } from 'viem';

export interface MessageHandlerConfig {
  walletAddress: string;
  chainId: number;
}

export function useMessageHandler({ walletAddress, chainId }: MessageHandlerConfig) {
  const { sendMessageToIFrame } = useUniversalPortability();

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMessage = async (event: MessageEvent) => {
      const { type, payload, requestId } = event.data;

      try {
        switch (type) {
          case 'INTERSEND_CONNECT_REQUEST':
            sendMessageToIFrame(
              {
                type: 'INTERSEND_CONNECT_RESPONSE',
                payload: {
                  address: walletAddress,
                  chainId,
                  isConnected: true
                }
              }
            );
            break;

          case 'SIGN_MESSAGE_REQUEST':
            // Handle message signing
            break;

          case 'TRANSACTION_REQUEST':
            // Handle transaction requests
            break;
        }
      } catch (error: any) {
        // Error handling
      }
    };

    window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('message', handleMessage);
  }, [walletAddress, chainId, sendMessageToIFrame]);
}
```

#### src/hooks/usePortHandler.ts

```typescript
import { useAccount, useChainId } from 'wagmi';
import { useMessageHandler } from './useMessageHandler';

export function usePortHandler() {
  const { address } = useAccount();
  const chainId = useChainId();

  useMessageHandler({
    walletAddress: address!,
    chainId: chainId!
  });

  return {
    isReady: Boolean(address && chainId)
  };
}
```

### 4. Create dApp Store Container

Intersend can serve as your "dApp store" aggregator. You can display all available apps, letting users pick which to launch. For instance:

```typescript
import { Port, usePortableApps } from 'universal-portability';

function DAppStoreContainer() {
  const { apps } = usePortableApps(); // array of dApp metadata

  return (
    <div className="dapp-grid">
      {apps.map(app => (
        <div key={app.id} className="dapp-card">
          <img src={app.logo} alt={app.name} />
          <h3>{app.name}</h3>
          <button onClick={() => navigateToApp(app)}>
            Launch {app.name}
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Render dApp Interface

When the user selects a dApp, you embed it:

```typescript
import { Port } from 'universal-portability';
import { useAccount, useChainId } from 'wagmi';

import { usePortHandler } from '../hooks/usePortHandler';

function AppContainer({ app }) {
  const rpcURL = process.env.RPC_URL;
  const { address } = useAccount();

  // enable postMessage communication
  usePortHandler();

  return (
    <Port
      src={`https://app.intersend.io/apps/${app.slug}`}
      address={address}
      rpcUrl={rpcURL}
      height="400px"
      width="800px"
    />
  );
}
```

### Message Protocol

The SDK uses a secure postMessage protocol with these main events:

* `INTERSEND_CONNECT_REQUEST`: Initial wallet connection request
* `SIGN_MESSAGE_REQUEST`: Request to sign a message
* `TRANSACTION_REQUEST`: Request to send a transaction
* `SWITCH_CHAIN_REQUEST`: Request to switch chain
* `*_RESPONSE`: Corresponding response events

All sensitive operations (signing, approvals) are handled by your wallet's existing security infrastructure, ensuring a safe and consistent user experience.
