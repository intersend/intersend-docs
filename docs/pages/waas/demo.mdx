# Demo - For Wallets & WaaS [Integrate apps into a wallet]

import { Callout } from 'vocs/components'

<Callout type="info">
**Interactive Wallet Demo**

This live demonstration showcases how wallet providers can seamlessly integrate third-party dApps directly within their wallet interface using Interspace.

What you're seeing below is a wallet replica that:
- Embeds external dApps using without users ever leaving your wallet
- Maintains complete control over the security and user experience
- Uses Interspace's SDK to handle all communication between the wallet and dApps

Try it yourself! Browse the available apps and launch them directly within the wallet interface to experience the seamless integration firsthand.
