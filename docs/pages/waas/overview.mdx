import { Callout } from 'vocs/components'

<Callout type="info">
**This guide is for you if:**  
You provide wallet infrastructure (MPC, custodial, non-custodial) (e.g UniversalX, MetaMask, Phantom) and want to:
- Offer curated dApps without maintaining it yourself
- Keep full control over security and UX
- Automatically integrate new apps added to Interspace
</Callout>

- **Security First**
  All transactions use your existing signing infrastructure - keys never leave your environment
- **Customizable Curation**
  Choose which apps to display and control their presentation

## How It Works

Under the hood, Interspace provides an iframe-based connector that mediates communication between your wallet and apps available on Intersend. Your wallet remains in control of signing, transaction approvals, and chain selection while Interspace relays messages securely via `postMessage`.

## Security Architecture

The SDK implements a secure messaging protocol between the embedded app and your wallet:

- **Isolated Iframes:**
  All third-party dApps are sandboxed within an iframe managed by Interspace. This prevents unauthorized access to your code or your users' private keys.

- **No Private Key Exposure:**
  Any signature or transaction request is forwarded to your wallet's internal signing logic. Keys never leave your environment.

- **Origin Validation:**
  The Interspace SDK verifies the origin of incoming messages. Suspicious or unknown sources are ignored.
