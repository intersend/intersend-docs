# Reusable Snippets

Documentation often requires repeating the same content in multiple places. Reusable snippets allow you to define content once and reuse it throughout your documentation.

## Basic Snippet Usage

Snippets allow you to store reusable content that can be included in multiple pages. This helps maintain consistency and reduces duplication.

### Creating Snippets

To create a snippet:

1. Add files in the `docs/snippets` directory with your reusable content
2. Use clear, descriptive names for your snippet files
3. Write your content in MDX format

For example, create a file at `docs/snippets/wallet-setup.mdx`:

```mdx
## Setting Up Your Wallet

To set up your Intersend wallet:

1. Download the Intersend app or visit [web.intersend.io](https://web.intersend.io)
2. Click "Create New Wallet"
3. Choose your preferred authentication method
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to secure your wallet
```

### Using Snippets in Documentation

You can then import and use this snippet in any of your documentation pages:

```mdx
import WalletSetup from '../snippets/wallet-setup.mdx'

# Getting Started

Before you can start using Intersend, you need to set up your wallet.

<WalletSetup />

Now that your wallet is set up, let's explore the features...

## Advanced Snippet Techniques

### Parameterized Snippets

You can pass parameters to your snippets for more flexibility:

```mdx
export const ApiEndpoint = ({ method, endpoint, description }) => (
  <div className="api-endpoint">
    <div className="method">{method}</div>
    <div className="endpoint">{endpoint}</div>
    <div className="description">{description}</div>
  </div>
);
```

Then use it with different values:

```mdx
<ApiEndpoint 
  method="GET" 
  endpoint="/api/v1/wallets" 
  description="Retrieve all user wallets" 
/>
```

### Snippet Categories

Organize your snippets into logical categories:

```
docs/
└── snippets/
    ├── setup/
    │   ├── wallet-setup.mdx
    │   └── api-setup.mdx
    ├── errors/
    │   ├── common-errors.mdx
    │   └── error-handling.mdx
    └── examples/
        ├── react-example.mdx
        └── node-example.mdx
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep snippets atomic** - Design snippets for a single, specific purpose
2. **Maintain consistency** - Use consistent naming and formatting
3. **Update centrally** - When changes are needed, update the snippet once
4. **Document parameters** - For parameterized snippets, document expected parameters
5. **Version control** - Keep snippets under version control along with your documentation
