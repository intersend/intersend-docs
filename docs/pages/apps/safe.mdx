# Safe Integration [Get your app listed on Interspace]

<Callout type="info">
  **This guide is for you if:**

You’re building a dApp and want to:

- Your dApp uses **Wagmi** for wallet interactions.
- If using an auth provider (e.g. Privy, Dynamic), refer to its dedicated guide.
</Callout>
## Integration Steps (Wagmi + Safe Example)

Below is the most common scenario: **you already use Wagmi** and need to ensure the Safe Connector is present so Interspace can auto-connect. If your app relies on Privy or Dynamic for auth, please see those guides.

### 1. Add (or Confirm) Safe Connector

Add the Safe connector to your Wagmi config. If your app already uses the Safe connector, you can skip this step.

```ts
import { createConfig, http } from 'wagmi'
import { mainnet, sepolia, polygon } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { createClient } from 'viem'
import { safe } from 'wagmi/connectors'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet, sepolia, polygon],
  connectors: [
    safe() // Add Safe connector
    // other connectors...
  ],
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
    [sepolia.id]: http(),
    [polygon.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

### 2. Whitelist Interspace Domain

Since Interspace loads your dApp in an iframe and communicates via postMessage, you must allow the following domains:

Required domains:

- `interspace.fi`
- `*.interspace.fi`

If you’re using a third-party authentication provider, ensure they also whitelist these domains to enable secure cross-domain communication.


### 3. Verify App Behavior Inside Interspace

1. **Open [Sandbox](https://interspace.fi/apps/sandbox)** and paste your web app’s URL into the address bar of the Interspace browser.
2. **Auto-connect** should kick in; Interspace will inject the user’s wallet data into your app.
3. **Test transaction or signing flows** to confirm everything relays properly.

### 4. Get Listed

Once integrated, submit your app for review:
