# Overview - For Apps [Get your app listed on Interspace]

<Callout type="info">
  **This guide is for you if:**

You’re building a dApp and want to:

- Get listed in Interspace ecosystem
- Distribute your app and reach crypto users through partner wallets
</Callout>

Interspace is a non-custodial app store for crypto apps that enables seamless Web3 interactions through a unified experience. The fundamental goal is: **make it simple for your app and your users to connect, sign, and transact**.

The integration enables seamless communication between your app and Interspace through:

- **Auto Connection**: Automatically connects user's wallet with your app on page load with SIWE authentication
- **Message Relay**: Handles transaction signing, message signing, and contract interactions through event listeners
- **Non-Intrusive**: Only activates when your app is accessed through Interspace, preserving your existing functionality

Below is a high-level guide for dApps that want to be listed in Interspace and auto-connect with users’ wallets via Interspace.

## Key Concepts

### Connectors

A “connector” is a small integration layer that allows Interspace to inject a user’s wallet/account into your dApp. We support multiple connector approaches, including:

- [For existing Safe apps](https://docs.interspace.fi/apps/safe)
- [For apps that are using Privy](https://docs.interspace.fi/apps/privy)
- [For apps that are using Dynamic](https://docs.interspace.fi/apps/dynamic)

### iFrame & Event Listeners

Interspace loads your app within an iframe, and sends/ expects events to:

1. **Auto-connect** the user’s wallet/account
2. **Relay transactions** for user signatures
3. **Share** signed data, chain switches, and transaction confirmations back to your dApp

Because of this, you need to **whitelist Interspace's domain** so your site can be embedded in an iframe and to allow cross-domain communication.
