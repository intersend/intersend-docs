# Auth Providers Overview

> **This guide is for you if:**
> 
> You provide authentication/wallet management infrastructure (e.g Privy, Dynamic) and want to:
> - Make client apps portable across Web3 interfaces (Worlcoin, Frames, Telegram, Safe)
> - Offer embeddable apps as a value-add feature
> - Expand ecosystem reach without additional work

Turn every app using your SDK into an embeddable component for Intersend-integrated wallets and platforms.

## Integration Benefits

- **Ecosystem Growth**
  Client apps become instantly available to all Intersend partner wallets
- **Zero Client Changes**
  Add Intersend connector at SDK layer - no app modifications needed
- **Universal Compatibility**
  Works with any partner wallet - making it easy to integrate apps with a few lines of code

## How It Works

Below is a simplified flow describing how an app (built with your auth SDK) interacts with a user's wallet through Intersend.

## Example

1. A wallet infrastructure provider (let's call this CoinPace Wallet) uses Intersend SDK to add "App X" into their explore page. *App X is built with your authentication SDK.*

2. Users click App X within CoinPace Wallet's interface. The app loads in an iframe.

3. Your Authentication SDK automatically injects Intersend's connector to App X at initial page load.

4. Intersend's iframe middleware facilitates sharing user's account with the app and automatically connects to it with SIWE (Sign in with Ethereum)

5. When transactions occur:
   1. App X constructs transaction data
   2. Intersend relays payload to CoinPace Wallet
   3. User approves/declines in native wallet UI
   4. Result propagates back to the app

### End Result
- The app is fully functional automatically connected to the user's wallet/account
- Transactions signatures chain switching etc. flow through Intersend's secure layer
