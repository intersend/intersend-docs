# API Reference

Welcome to the Intersend API documentation. This section provides detailed information about our API endpoints, authentication methods, and request/response formats.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You'll need to include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is:

```
https://api.intersend.io/v1
```

## Endpoints

Our API provides the following main endpoint categories:

- [Create Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/create) - Create new resources
- [Get Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get) - Retrieve resource data
- [Delete Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/delete) - Remove resources

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format and follow a standard structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data goes here
  },
  "error": null
}
```

In case of an error, the response will include error details:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error description"
  }
}
